## 👋 Hi

My name is German. I love writing server- and networking-bound software. 

😞 I *hate* working on anything related to graphics, be that some GUI or a game client. 

❤️ I *love* creating the magic behind these graphics, that is, the backends and what bridges them and consumers of the data they provide.

ℹ️ I mainly **write** `Kotlin` and `Java`. I also have some minor experience writing `C++`, `Rust`, `Python`, and a few other languages.

💬 I **speak** `English` (upper-intermediate) and `Russian` (native). Capable of comprehending very-very basic `Japanese`.




## 📝 My most interesting projects
