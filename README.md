## 👋 Hi




### My name is German. I have a passion for working with game-, backend-, and AI- related software.

###### I'm also known as `DarksideCode` or `DarksideSkid`.


- 💀 I **hate** working on anything related to graphics, be that some GUI or a game client renderer.

- ❤️ I **love** creating the magic behind these graphics — the backends and what bridges them and the end user.

- 💻 I mainly **write** `Kotlin` and `Java`. Got some other experience (in descending order): `Rust`, `Python`, `C++`, some other.

- 🌎 I **speak** `English` and `Russian` well. Can comprehend the most basic `Japanese`.
