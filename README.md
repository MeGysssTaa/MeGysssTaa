## 👋 Hi

My name is German *(that's my first name, not the Deutsch language!)*. I love writing software that powers something that people use. 

😞 I *hate* working on anything related to graphics, be that some GUI or a game client. 

❤️ Instead, I prefer creating the magic behind these graphics, that is, the backends, the algorithms — the *real programs* in my understanding.

ℹ️ I mainly **write** `Java`. At the moment, I'm also studying `Rust`, and it seems that I'm really getting to *love* this language! I also have some minor experience writing `C++` and `Python`.

💬 I **speak** `English` (upper-intermediate) and `Russian` (native). Can speak very simple `Japanese` (been learning it for a while, but had forgotten most stuff by now — although I can easily re-learn it anytime). Planning to learn German soon™️.




## 📝 My most interesting projects

At the moment, I treat these projects as my most interesting:
* [**Reflex**](https://g.reflex.rip/spigot) — a premium (paid) Minecraft server-side anticheat with extra focus on combat mods (KillAura, Aimbot, and so on).
* [**Keiko**](https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/keiko-plugin-inspector) — an open-source Minecraft server plugins inspector and security tool that makes it much more safe for server administrators to install plugins from untrusted sources.
* [**LVQ4J**](https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/lvq4j) — a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of the Learning Vector Quantization neural network in Java (a library).
* [**As We Drown**](https://github.com/AsWeDrown) — a multiplayer adventure quest-based game written quickly for my university exam (pretty raw, but working).
* [**Access Warden**](https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/access-warden) — a powerful Java access restrictions enforcement toolkit that helps people with some secrets write more secure programs.
